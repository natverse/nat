\description{
Open customised rgl window
}
\details{
Pan with right button (Ctrl+click), zoom with middle
  (Alt/Meta+click) button. On a Mac trackpad, pan with two fingers
  left-right, zoom with two fingers in-out. Defaults to a white background
  and orthogonal projection (FOV=0)

  Note that sometimes (parts of) objects seem to disappear after panning and
  zooming. See help for \code{\link{pan3d}}.

  \code{\link{rgl}} and \code{\link[plotly:plot_ly]{plotly}} have quite
  different models for how to handle the active plot. \code{nopen3d} and
  \code{\link{nclear3d}} allow you to treat them more similarly. Use them
  wherever you use the rgl \code{clear3d} and \code{open3d} commands and your
  could she be able to run with both \bold{plotly} or \bold{rgl} as the
  \code{plotengine}.
