# nat 1.11.0

* This represents a major update compared with previous versions on CRAN 
  (most recently 1.8.25). I have tested extensively (see below) but there is an 
  increased chance of issues given that this is a major new release.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.5.1
* ubuntu 24.04 (on github actions), R 4.5.1
* win-builder (release and devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

Please note that previous versions of R reported possible spelling errors in 
the DESCRIPTION file, but these were all false positives.
