\title{Get the bounding box of an image volume or object containing 3D vertices}
\usage{
boundingbox(x, ...)

\method{boundingbox}{im3d}(x, dims = dim(x), ...)

\method{boundingbox}{character}(x, ...)

\method{boundingbox}{default}(x, na.rm = FALSE, ...)

boundingbox(x) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{im3d} object or any object for which
\code{\link{xyzmatrix}} can extract 3D points (e.g. neurons, surfaces etc),
or, for \code{boundingbox.character}, a character vector specifying a file.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods, and eventually to
\code{\link{makeboundingbox}}}

\item{dims}{The number of voxels in each dimension when x is a BoundingBox 
matrix.}

\item{na.rm}{Whether to ignore NA points (default \code{FALSE})}

\item{value}{The object which will provide the new boundingbox information.
This can be be either an im3d object with a boundingbox or a vector or
matrix defined according to \code{boundingbox.default}.}
}
\value{
a \code{matrix} with 2 rows and 3 columns with
  \code{class='boundingbox'} or \emph{NULL} when missing.
}
\description{
Set the bounding box of an im3d object
}
\details{
The bounding box is defined as the position of the voxels at the two
  opposite corners of the cuboid encompassing an image, \emph{when each voxel
  is assumed to have a single position (sometimes thought of as its centre)
  \strong{and no physical extent.}} When written as a vector it should look
  like: \code{c(x0,x1,y0,y1,z0,z1)}. When written as a matrix it should look
  like: \code{rbind(c(x0,y0,z0),c(x1,y1,z1))} where x0,y0,z0 is the position
  of the origin.

  Note that there are two competing definitions for the physical extent of an
  image that are discussed e.g.
  \url{http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html}. The definition that
  makes most sense depends largely on whether you think of a pixel as a
  little square with some defined area (and therefore a voxel as a cube with
  some defined volume) \emph{or} you take the view that you can only define
  with certainty the grid points at which image data was acquired. The first
  view implies a physical extent which we call the  \code{bounds=dim(x) *
  c(dx,dy,dz)}; the second is defined as \code{BoundingBox=dim(x)-1 *
  c(dx,dy,dz)} and assumes that the extent of the image is defined by a
  cuboid including the sample points at the extreme corner of the grid. Amira
  takes this second view and this is the one we favour given our background
  in microscopy. If you wish to convert a \code{bounds} type definition into
  an im3d BoundingBox, you should pass the argument \code{input='bounds'}.

\code{boundingbox.default} is designed to be used on objects that
  contain 3D point information. This includes any object for which an
  \code{\link{xyzmatrix}} method is defined including \code{matrix} or
  \code{data.frame} objects describing 3D points as well as specialised
  classes such as \code{\link{neuron}}, \code{\link{neuronlist}}, \code{rgl}
  \code{\link{mesh3d}} objects.
