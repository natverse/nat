nat 1.8.13
==========

This release backports a few urgent fixes to the 1.8 branch

* Fix very slow loading of neurons in `neuronlistfh()` objects. 
  Apparently due to a change in behaviour in R 3.6.0 (#402).
  Thanks to Shanice Bailey and Lisa Marin for the bug report.
* Fix ndigest check error on CRAN (#411)

It also updates URLs to point to nat's new home organisation on GitHub 
(https://github.com/natverse/).

nat 1.8.12
==========
* Speed up (2-3x) summary.neuron(list) by faster calculation of total cable
  length. Note that this may cause some changes in the reported cable length
  because all cable is now included (as it should always have been). (#361)
* fix bug: dotprops do not get resampled labels bug (#360)
* Add nview3d function to set anatomical viewpoints (#359)

nat 1.8.11
==========
Fixes
* pointsinside fails for points >1e5 from mesh (#354)

  this is helpful if you e.g. delete nodes/edges from an ngraph object
* breaking change with testthat v2 #355

nat 1.8.10
==========
* pointsinside now works with alpha shape (ashape3d) objects directly (#350)

  (fixes errors with missing cygwin DLLs)
* workaround for some functions (eg those using CMTK registration folders) that
  were affected by file.exists("/some/real/registration.list/") returning FALSE
  on Windows
* Fix cmtk.reformatx under Cygwin - output NRRD file path (but not other paths)
  must be munged for reformatx - not sure why this isn't handled internally.
* Fix as.mesh3d.ashape3d messing up the order of triangle vertices 
  which was giving problems with pointsinside (#349)
* Fix pointsinside to return TRUE for vertices defining mesh (with distance=0)
  (#348)
* Switch pointsinside to use Rvcg::vcgClostKD, thereby fixing some cases
  where points were incorrectly reported to be inside a surface. (#352)

nat 1.8.9
=========
* fix reading of neurons when origin is not an endpoint (#342)
  nb this bug was introduced in 1.8.8

* add PlotSubTrees option for plot.neuron (#339)
  thanks to Zhihao Zheng

nat 1.8.8
=========
* add xyzmatrix<-.neuronlist so that we can replace the vertices of a set of 
  objects in one go (#328)
* add as.mesh3d.ashape3d thereby adding support for 3D alpha surfaces generated 
  by the alphashape3d package (#337)

documentation visible at http://natverse.github.io/nat/ including two vignettes.

* Teach xform and friends to transform soma positions (#206)
* Copy attributes (including templatebrains) of neuronlists when subsetting (#310)
* Fix error in read.amiramesh for RLE encoded files. (#317)
  (reported by K. Hornik)
* replace nat::trim with base::trimws (#313)

nat 1.8.6
=========
* Add xform.data.frame method (#309)
* Add invert_reglist function (#308)
* Fix bug in imslice storing position of new singleton dim (#306)
* Fix namespace issues for smooth_neuron

nat 1.8.5
=========
The main feature of this release is improved support for nat+CMTK on Windows.

* teach voxdims.character to get voxel dimensions straight from image file on 
  disk enhancement (#303)
* teach coord2ind to accept nat.templatebrains objects for imdims (#302)
* add simple smooth_neuron function (#300)
* fix bug reading amira surfaces when Color precedes Id (#305)
* cmtk.reformatx needs to use system2 (#301)
* Don't use shell features on Windows (#295)

nat 1.8.4
=========

* Fix simplification of reglist containing one cmtkreg (#297)
* Don't lose swap attribute when >1 cmtk registrations in reglist (#296)
* Documentation improvements for neurons and file formats

nat 1.8.3
=========
* nat now handles compound registrations via reglist objects (#286).
  These can contain homogeneous affine, CMTK registrations (in disk or in memory)
  and R functions (which can be used to wrap arbitrary registration types not 
  directly supported by nat). NB xformimage.reglist will currently only work for 
  CMTK compatible registrations.
* add mask(.im3d) function to zero out parts of an image (#285)
  Looks after im3d attributes and material name to integer pixel level mapping.
* add read.ngraph.swc which can be used to read even malformed SWC files (such
  as those containing cycles) (#282). 
  This is exposed by giving read.neuron an argument class, which can be set to 
  'ngraph' instead of 'neuron'.
  Inspired by https://github.com/BigNeuron/BigNeuron-Wiki/wiki/BigNeuron-Imperial-College-London-Hackathon-Discussion-Notes

* Fix invert option of subset/prune_vertices returns an error with igraph::dfs 
  points (#288)
* Fix fileformats(, rval='info') to return a well-formatted data.frame
* The idiom neuronlist[,] will never drop columns (since it is a useful shortcut
  for as.data.frame(neuronlist)) (#277)

nat 1.8.2
=========
* roll back rgl NULL mode changes from 1.8.0 in favour of less invasive approach
  of marking the majority of rgl based plotting examples as donttest (#274)

nat 1.8.1
=========
* fix non-canonical URLs to CRAN packages (thanks to Uwe Ligges)

nat 1.8.0
=========
This is tagged as a major release because of a change in behaviour that (by 
default) suppresses interactive rgl windows when running in batch 
(non-interactive) mode. See ?nat "rgl Package" section for details.

* nat will only activate an rgl display in interactive mode, otherwise 
  defaulting to rgl's NULL mode display. This should help run nat in batch mode
  situations including knitr runs, the CRAN build server etc. (#272)
* Add summary.neuron(list) functions to calculate tree statistics such as number
 of nodes and cable length for neurons/neuronlists (#269)
* Automate progress bar in nlapply - this will always show in interactive mode
  when there are more than 10 neurons being processed. (#271)
* Fix bug in c.neuronlist when combining more than 2 neuronlists (#270)
* Fix bug in read.neuronlistfh on Windows (#268)

  based on internal variables such as position, width, vertex number etc while
  still producing a valid neuron with an appropriate graph structure (#261)
* this depends on a new low level function prune_vertices that can remove 
  specified vertices
* this has also enabled the prune.neuron method to be defined for the first time
  enabling pruning by spatial proximity ()
* teach mirror to work with image data (#265) and enable better handling of the 
  mirrorAxisSize by allowing this to be supplied as a bounding box (#254)
* teach as.im3d.matrix to use an im3d object to specify the desired space (#263)
  This enables for example a set or tracings to be turned into volume data that
  exactly matches a specific template brain.
* fix bug: seglengths fails for neurons with multiple trees bug (#257)
* fix bug: xformpoint.cmtkreg fails for in memory registration lists (#259)

  xform/image/points (all 3 expect reg to be in sample to ref order and for any
  individual registration to be marked with swap=T if it is ref->sample)

* support for automatic download of neurons from stashR remote repositories on
  the web. ?neuronlistfh for details and an example. 
* Relies on stashR package
* dev: small doc fixes to make package CRAN compatible.

nat 0.8
=======
* important new feature: neuronlistfh objects backed by an on disk filehash
  allow single neurons to be loaded from disk on demand
* this allows 1) fast startup suitable for knitr documents and 2) working with
  more neurons than fit in main memory
* of course this is slower than working with an in-memory list but for plotting
  etc this should not be problem
* furthermore neuronlistfh objects can be subsetted/converted to give in memory
  neuronlist objects.

nat 0.7
=======
* implement read.neuron and read.neurons
* so far only works for rda, rds and swc files
* reading of additional file types will be implemented by registering functions =
  to test, read and write for the format using a package regsistry controlled by
  nat::neuronformats.
* developer: seglists in neurons now have class 'seglist'

nat 0.6
=======
* major new functionality - bidirectional interconversion of graph and regular
  neuron representation
* see as.neuron.* methods and as.ngraph.* methods
* plan is to use graph representation as the common intermediate with reading 
  different neuron file formats
* depends on igraph package

nat 0.5.2
=========
* add subset.neuronlist
* add methods for working with dataframe attached to neuronlist 
  (see e.g. ?with.neuronlist)
* TODO harmonise plot3d.neuronlist subset expressions with subset.neuronlist

nat 0.5.1
=========
* Switch license to GPL-3
* xform (transformation) of hxsurf objects
* fix xform of neuronlist objects
* switch from CMTK gregxform to streamxform (gregxform is deprecated; streamxform can concatenate registrations)
* teach mirror function to accept numeric axis specification
* Fix bug in checking extra directories in cmtk.bindir
* Add dotprops.neuronlist and include all dotprops methods in documentation
* Fix longstanding bug in parsing cmtk warping registrations (only relevant for
  reading these into R lists - no effect on transformations).
* fix bug in class of cmtkreg objects
* Remove call to .Internal(La_rs) by calling eigen directly
* doc: some notes on CMTK installation

nat 0.5
=======
* fix broken handling of cmtk affine transformations
* implement mirroring of neurons and other objects
* teach xformpoints (and therefore xform) to handle "~/" in paths
* bugfix in visibility of S3method xformpoints.character
* (developer) Switch to roxygen2 v3.0 for documentation

nat 0.4
=======
* read.hxsurf and plot3d.hxsurf for reading/plotting Amira surfaces
* better handling of location of cmtk command line tools see ?cmtk for details
* add neuronlist and associated methods (including plot)
* plot3d for neurons and dotprops

nat 0.3
=======
* basic and self-contained implementation of neuron class
* basic and self-contained implementation of dotprops
* new xform generic + methods for clean transformation of objects including
  neurons and dotprops objects
* this includes improved interaction between dotprops and xform so that xform
  can use the previously value of k when recalculating a dotprops object post
  transformation
* sample data (40 PNs from Jefferis, Potter et al. '07 and 20 KCs from Chiang 
  et al. 2011)
* 1 use of .Internal and missing nlapply remain to be fixed.

nat 0.2.1
=========
* fix install error due to missing neuron(*).R files that contain docs only so far

nat 0.2
=======
* Fairly complete implementation of CMTK registration I/O and geometry
* All functionality is self-contained (i.e. independent of nat.as/AnalysisSuite)
* passes check()
* can be augmented by nat.as (0.6)
