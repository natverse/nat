Description: This package is a reboot of the AnalysisSuite
    (https://github.com/jefferis/AnalysisSuite) bundle of R code that I have
    been using for a number of years to analyse and visualise 3D biological
    image data, especially traced neurons. AnalysisSuite is most easily
    installed using the nat.as package presently available at
    https://github.com/jefferis/nat.as. The nat package is considerably cleaner
    but currently provides only a subset of the full functionality of nat.as /
    AnalysisSuite. nat can read 3D images and surfaces in Amira formats. Traced
    neurons can be imported from SWC and Amira SkeletonGraph format. These data
    can then be visualised in 3D via rgl, manipulated including applying
    calculated registrations, e.g. using the CMTK registration suite, and
    analysed. There package also has a simple representation for neurons that
    have been subjected to a 3D skeletonisation but not formally traced; this
    allows morphological comparison between neurons including searches and
    clustering.
Depends:
    R (>= 2.15.1),
    rgl
Imports:
    RANN,
    igraph,
    methods,
    filehash
