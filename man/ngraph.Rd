\title{ngraph: a graph to encode a neuron's connectivity}
\usage{
ngraph(
  el,
  vertexnames,
  xyz = NULL,
  diam = NULL,
  directed = TRUE,
  weights = FALSE,
  vertex.attributes = NULL,
  graph.attributes = NULL
)

as.ngraph(x, ...)

\method{as.ngraph}{data.frame}(x, directed = TRUE, ...)

\method{as.ngraph}{neuron}(x, directed = TRUE, method = c("swc", "seglist"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{el}{A two column matrix (start, end) defining edges. \code{start} means
closer to the root (soma) of the neuron.}

\item{vertexnames}{Integer names for graph nodes - the edge list is specified
using these names (see details).}

\item{xyz}{3D coordinates of vertices (optional, Nx3 matrix, or Nx4 matrix
when 4th column is assumed to be diameter)}

\item{diam}{Diameter of neuron at each vertex (optional)}

\item{directed}{Whether the resultant graph should be directed (default TRUE)}

\item{weights}{Logical value indicating whether edge weights defined by the
3D distance between points should be added to graph (default \code{FALSE})
\emph{or} a numeric vector of weights.}

\item{vertex.attributes, graph.attributes}{List of named attributes to be
added to the graph. The elements of \code{vertex.attributes} must be
vectors whose length is compatible with the number of elements in the
graph. See \code{\link[igraph]{set_vertex_attr}} for details.}

\item{x}{Object to convert (see method descriptions)}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to methods}

\item{method}{Whether to use the swc data (x$d) or the seglist to define 
neuronal connectivity to generate graph.}
}
\value{
an \code{igraph} object with additional class \code{ngraph}, having a
  vertex for each entry in vertexnames, each vertex having a \code{label}
  attribute. All vertices are included whether connected or not.
}
\description{
the \code{ngraph} class contains a (completely general) graph
  representation of a neuron's connectivity in an \code{igraph} object. It
  may additionally contain vertex name or position data. See Connectivity
  section.

  \code{ngraph()} creates an ngraph from edge and vertex information.

\code{as.ngraph} converts an object to an ngraph

\code{as.ngraph.dataframe} construct ngraph from a data.frame 
  containing SWC format data

\code{as.ngraph.neuron} construct ngraph from a neuron
}
\details{
Note that the \code{as.ngraph.neuron} method \emph{always} keeps the
  original vertex names (a.k.a. PointNo) as read in from the original file.
}
\section{Connectivity}{
 We make the following assumptions about neurons coming
  in

  \itemize{

  \item They have an integer vertex name that need not start from 1 and that
  may have gaps. This is analogous to the PointNo field of the core data
  block of \code{\link{neuron}} objects.

  \item The edge list that defines connectivity specifies those edges using
  pairs of vertex names, _not_ raw vertex indices.

  }

  We make no attempt to determine the root points at this stage.

  The raw vertex ids in the graph will be in the order of vertexnames and can
  therefore be used to index a block of vertex coordinates. The vertexnames
  will be stored using the vertex attribute \code{name}. The underlying
  igraph class allows nodes to be specified by their name. This provides a
  convenient way to define nodes in an ngraph object by the numeric
  identifier encoded by the PointNo field of the corresponding
  \code{\link{neuron}}.

  When the graph is directed (default) the edges will be from the root to the
  other tips of the neuron.
}

\section{Morphology}{
 The morphology of the neuron is encoded by the
  combination of connectivity information (i.e. the graph) and spatial data
  encoded as the 3D position and diameter of each vertex. Position
  information is stored as vertex attributes X, Y, and Z.

n=Cell07PNs[[1]]
g=as.ngraph(n)
library(igraph)
# check that vertex attributes of graph match X position
all.equal(V(g)$X, n$d$X)

# Use 3D segment lengths as edge length of graph

# find longest path across graph
d=get.diameter(gw)
# make a new neuron using the longest path
gw_spine=as.neuron(induced_subgraph(gw, d))
