nat 1.8.22
==========

* version bump owing to package archival 

nat 1.8.21
==========

* tweaks to the news file format picked up on cran linux pretest 
  (but strangely not win-devel etc)

nat 1.8.20
==========

* replace deprected rgl functions
* update igraph test for compatability 

nat 1.8.18
==========

* Fix errors in `neurons-intro` vignette when pandoc is missing

nat 1.8.17
==========

* Suggest webshot2 to cope with changes in rgl snapshot behaviour (at the request of BDR for CRAN)
* Fix URLs

nat 1.8.16
==========

* Fix further failing URLs from CRAN pre-test

nat 1.8.15
==========

* Fix failing test on CRAN for R 4.1 (thanks to KH, #444).

nat 1.8.14
==========

* Fix failing test on CRAN when Rvcg unavailable (thanks to BDR).

nat 1.8.13
==========

* backports a few urgent fixes to the 1.8 branch
* Fix very slow loading of neurons in neuronlistfh() objects. 
  Apparently due to a change in behaviour in R 3.6.0 (#402).
  Thanks to Shanice Bailey and Lisa Marin for the bug report.
* Fix ndigest check error on CRAN (#411)
* also updates URLs to point to nat's new home organisation on GitHub 
https://github.com/natverse.

nat 1.8.12
==========
* Speed up (2-3x) summary.neuron(list) by faster calculation of total cable
  length. Note that this may cause some changes in the reported cable length
  because all cable is now included (as it should always have been). (#361)
* fix bug: dotprops do not get resampled labels bug (#360)
* Add nview3d function to set anatomical viewpoints (#359)

nat 1.8.11
==========

* pointsinside fails for points >1e5 from mesh (#354)
* as.neuron should work for an igraph made from an ngraph (#356)
  this is helpful if you e.g. delete nodes/edges from an ngraph object
* breaking change with testthat v2 #355

nat 1.8.10
==========
* pointsinside now works with alpha shape (ashape3d) objects directly (#350)
* On windows add cygwin binary directory to path if not present 
  (fixes errors with missing cygwin DLLs)
* workaround for some functions (eg those using CMTK registration folders) that
  were affected by file.exists("/some/real/registration.list/") returning FALSE
  on Windows
* Fix cmtk.reformatx under Cygwin - output NRRD file path (but not other paths)
  must be munged for reformatx - not sure why this isn't handled internally.
* Fix as.mesh3d.ashape3d messing up the order of triangle vertices 
  which was giving problems with pointsinside (#349)
* Fix pointsinside to return TRUE for vertices defining mesh (with distance=0)
  (#348)
* Switch pointsinside to use Rvcg::vcgClostKD, thereby fixing some cases
  where points were incorrectly reported to be inside a surface. (#352)

nat 1.8.9
=========
* fix reading of neurons when origin is not an endpoint (#342)
  nb this bug was introduced in 1.8.8
* fix edge case for is.neuron when applied to tibbles (#338)
* add PlotSubTrees option for plot.neuron (#339)
  thanks to Zhihao Zheng

nat 1.8.8
=========
* add xyzmatrix<-.neuronlist so that we can replace the vertices of a set of 
  objects in one go (#328)
* add as.mesh3d.ashape3d thereby adding support for 3D alpha surfaces generated 
  by the alphashape3d package (#337)
* add as.hxsurf to convert surfaces (#332)
* add nvertices as generic method to find the number of vertices in an object 
  (#329)
* add plot3d.cmtkreg to visualise domain of CMTK registration (#333)
* speed up resample function (and seglist2swc) (#336)
* add an option to override default progress bar behaviour for nlapply (and many
  other functions that use it) (#322)
* make plot3d more forgiving of colour specification (#331)
* fix overwrite=T option for landmarks files (#319)
* fix prune_edges for paths with opposing edge directions (#320)
* make read.amiramesh cope with different NA values (#324)
* fix crashing bug in read.neuron.hxlineset for malformed files (#325)
* only warn if xform.neuronlist fails to transform soma positions (#326)

nat 1.8.7
=========
* This release includes some bug fixes and significantly improved online package
documentation visible at http://natverse.github.io/nat/ including two vignettes:
* Teach xform and friends to transform soma positions (#206)
* Copy attributes (including templatebrains) of neuronlists when subsetting (#310)
* Fix error in read.amiramesh for RLE encoded files. (#317)
  (reported by K. Hornik)
* replace nat::trim with base::trimws (#313)

nat 1.8.6
=========
* Add xform.data.frame method (#309)
* Add invert_reglist function (#308)
* Fix bug in imslice storing position of new singleton dim (#306)
* Fix namespace issues for smooth_neuron

nat 1.8.5
=========
* The main feature of this release is improved support for nat+CMTK on Windows.
* teach voxdims.character to get voxel dimensions straight from image file on 
  disk enhancement (#303)
* teach coord2ind to accept nat.templatebrains objects for imdims (#302)
* add simple smooth_neuron function (#300)
* fix bug reading amira surfaces when Color precedes Id (#305)
* cmtk.reformatx needs to use system2 (#301)
* Don't use shell features on Windows (#295)
