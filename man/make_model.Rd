\title{Generate a 3D model from connector and/or tree node data}
\usage{
make_model(
  x,
  substrate = c("cable", "connectors", "both"),
  alpha = 30,
  auto.selection = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a neuronlist or neuron object, or another object that consists of 3D points}

\item{substrate}{whether to make the model based on the 3D location of
connectors, neuron cable or both. Connectors are pre-synapse locations, 
e.g. the pre-synapses of a \code{catmaidneuron} from the R package \code{catmaid})}

\item{alpha}{a single value or vector of values for alpha, fed to
\code{alphashape3d::ashape3d}. Selection is subsequently interactive.}

\item{auto.selection}{logical, whether or not to try and remove points based on interactively
choosing simple values for clustering.}
}
\value{
A mesh3d object
}
\description{
Generate a mesh3d model based on points contained in a
  neuronlist or neuron object, or another object that consists of 3D points.
}
\details{
Interactive function that allows a users to select points in 3D space from neuronlist/neuron objects,
or another object that is coercible in 3D points using \code{\link{xyzmatrix}}. Points can first be automatically chosen, by
selecting an integer number of nearest neighbours to find for each point using \code{nabor::\link{knn}}, and then a 
maximum distance at which nodes can be part of a cluster. Next, \code{\link{select_points}} is used to manually pick desired 3D
points. Lastly, \code{alphashape3d::ashape3d} is used to create an alphashape around these points. The user can trial different values for
alpha until they get their desired result.
