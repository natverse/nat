# nat 1.8.24

This submission fixes a test failure noted by Prof Brian Ripley. This was 
occasioned by a minor bug in the the recent igraph 2.0 release. 
Although an igraph update is expected soon, this nat release
should work around the current issue. I have also addressed a few NOTES
relating to Rd formatting issues.

With many thanks,

Greg Jefferis.
