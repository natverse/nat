\arguments{
\item{f}{Path to a file}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[XML]{xmlParse}}.}

\item{simplify}{Whether to return a single neuron as a \code{neuron} object
rather than a \code{neuronlist} of length 1.}

\item{components}{Which components to read in (path or fill). Only paths are
properly supported at present (see details).}

\item{Verbose}{Whether to print status messages during parsing.}

Read a neuron saved by Fiji's Simple Neurite Tracer Plugin
}
\details{
simple neurite tracer .traces files are an XML based format so
  parsing it depends on installation of the suggested XML package.

  They can contain both paths (skeleton lines) and fill information (saved as
  XYZ coordinates of voxels inside the object). The latter cannot currently
  be handled very well by \code{\link{read.neuron}}. If you wish to access
  them you will probably need to use the private \code{read.fijixml} function
  to do so (see examples).

  Your best best if you want to produce a fully 3D object with "width"
  information would be to generate a 3D mesh using Fiji's 3D viewer. You can
  do this by selecting the object in the viewer and the choosing \code{File
  ... Export Surface ... Wavefront} \emph{while the 3D viewer window is
  active}. The resultant obj file can then be read in by
  \code{\link{read.neurons}}. You could use this mesh to find radius
  information for a skeleton by shooting rays from skeleton to mesh to
  estimate the radius.
