\title{Read a neuron in swc file format}
\usage{
read.neuron.swc(f, ...)

read.ngraph.swc(f, weights = FALSE, directed = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{path to file}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. \code{read.neuron.swc} passes these to
\code{\link{as.neuron}} and then on to \code{\link{neuron}}.
\code{read.neuron.swc} passes them to \code{\link{ngraph}}.}

\item{weights}{Logical value indicating whether edge weights defined by the
3D distance between points should be added to graph (default \code{FALSE})
\emph{or} a numeric vector of weights.}

\item{directed}{Whether the resultant graph should be directed (default TRUE)}
}
\description{
\code{read.neuron.swc} reads an SWC file on disk into a fully
  parsed \code{\link{neuron}} representation. However we normally recommend
  using \code{\link[=read.neuron]{read.neuron(s)}} since those functions cope
  with any file type.

\code{read.ngraph.swc} reads an SWC file on disk into the more 
  generic (and forgiving) \code{\link{ngraph}} representation which provides
  a bridge to the \code{\link[igraph]{igraph}} library.
}
\details{
These functions will accept SWC neurons with multiple trees and
  arbitrary point index order. However only \code{read.ngraph.swc} will
  accept SWC files with cycles.

  These functions would normally be called from
  \code{\link[=read.neuron]{read.neuron(s)}} rather than used directly. The
  only benefit of using \code{read.neuron.swc} is to avoid a very small
  overhead in identifying the SWC file type. Note that only
  \code{\link{read.neurons}} can read many files in one command to construct
  a \code{\link{neuronlist}} object.

\section{SWC Format}{
 According to
  \url{http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html}
   SWC file format has a radius not a diameter specification
