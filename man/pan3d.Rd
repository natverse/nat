pan3d(button)
}
\arguments{
\item{button}{Integer from 1 to 3 indicating mouse button}

\details{
Copied verbatim from ?rgl.setMouseCallbacks for rgl version 0.92.892 Mouse
button 2 is right and button 3 is middle (accessed by Meta/Alt key)

Note that sometimes (parts of) objects seem to disappear after panning and
zooming. The example in \code{\link[rgl]{rgl.setMouseCallbacks}} from which
this is copied includes a note that "this doesn't play well with rescaling"
