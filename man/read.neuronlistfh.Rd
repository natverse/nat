\title{Read a local, or remote, neuronlistfh object saved to a file.}
\usage{
read.neuronlistfh(file, localdir = NULL, update = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The file path of the neuronlistfh object. Can be local, or remote
(via http or ftp).}

\item{localdir}{If the file is to be fetched from a remote location, this is 
the folder in which downloaded RDS file will be saved. The default value of
\code{NULL} will save to a folder in the current R sessions temporary
folder. See details.}

\item{update}{Whether to update local copy of neuronlistfh (default: FALSE, 
see details)}

\item{...}{Extra arguments to pass to \code{download.file}.}
}
\description{
Read a local, or remote, neuronlistfh object saved to a file.
}
\details{
When reading a remote \code{neuronlistfh} object, it is downloaded 
  and cached to \code{localdir}. If there is already a cached file at the 
  appropriate location and \code{update=TRUE} then the md5sums are checked 
  and the downloaded file will be copied on top of the original copy if they 
  are different; if \code{udpate=FALSE}, the default, then no action will be 
  taken. After downloading a remote \code{neuronlistfh} object, a check is 
  made for the existence of the \code{data} directory that will be used to 
  individual objects. If this does not exist it will be created.
  
  Note also that there is a \emph{strict convention} for the layout of the 
  files on disk. The neuronlistfh object will be saved in R's \code{RDS} 
  format and will be placed next to a folder called \code{data} which will 
  contain the data objects, also saved in RDS format. For example if 
  \code{myneurons.rds} is downloaded to 
  \code{localdir="\\path\\to\\localdir"} the resultant file layout will be as
  follows:
  
  \itemize{
  
  \item \code{\\path\\to\\localdir\\myneurons.rds}
  
  \item \code{\\path\\to\\localdir\\data\\2f88e16c4f21bfcb290b2a8288c05bd0}
  
  \item \code{\\path\\to\\localdir\\data\\5b58e040ee35f3bcc6023fb7836c842e}
  
  \item \code{\\path\\to\\localdir\\data\... etc}
  
  }
  
  Given this arrangement, the data directory should always be at a fixed 
  location with respect to the saved neuronlistfh object and this is enforced
  on download and the default behaviour on read and write. However it does 
  remain possible (if not recommended) to site the neuronlistfh and filehash 
  database directory in different relative locations; if the neuronlistfh 
  object specified by file does not have a filehash database with a valid 
  \code{dir} slot and there is no 'data' directory adjacent to the 
  neuronlistfh object, an error will result.
