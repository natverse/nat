\title{Read CMTK TypedStream file to a list in memory}
\usage{
read.cmtk(con, CheckLabel = TRUE)

\item{CheckLabel}{Check, fix and warn for invalid or duplicate labels 
(default TRUE)}

\description{
This function is primarily of developer interest. End users will typically 
want to use more specialised functions for reading registrations and 
landmarks.
}
\details{
This is the default format used by CMTK for registration, studylist,
  landmarks and image files. Although this is largely a generic function, 
  there is special handling of the coefficients and active members of the 
  spline warp component of a CMTK nonrigid registration.

Note that if an open connection is passed to read.cmtk the version 
  number of the CMTK TypedStream will not be checked or recorded.
